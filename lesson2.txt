Handling events
So far we have only looked at React apps that are "static": 
they don't respond to user input. This lesson we will look at 
making our apps dynamic.

Recap: First-class functions in JavaScrip
Before we look more at React we need to recap a concept in JavaScript. 
You may remember that functions in JavaScript are "first class" - that means 
we can pass a reference to a function (as a variable) and then call it elsewhere. 
Let's look at an example

function hello() {
  return "Hello!";
}

console.log(hello); // Logs: "ƒ hello() {}"
console.log(hello()); // Logs: "Hello!"


In the example above hello is a reference to a function. In the first console.log 
we log out the whole function. The function is not called until we use parentheses (), 
so we only log the string "Hello!" in the second console.log.
This is a really important and useful in React, as we can make a function and pass
it to React so that it can call it when a user interacts with our app.


Event handlers in components
In previous lessons (not React) we learned how to attach 
event listeners with addEventListener:

// Create an event handler
function logWhenClicked() {
  console.log("buttonElement was clicked!");
}

// Listen for events and call the event handler when triggered
buttonElement.addEventListener("click", logWhenClicked);

We still need to listen to events in React,
but event handlers are set up in a slightly different way

function ClickLogger() {
  function logWhenClicked() {
    console.log("Button was clicked!");
  }

  return <button onClick={logWhenClicked}>Click me!</button>;
}

Every element in React has some special props that start with on 
that can be assigned to a function which will be called when the event is triggered.

Here's a few examples (a full list is available here):

onClick - the element was clicked
onCopy - the clipboard is used to copy some text
onKeyDown - a key is pressed down
onBlur - the element loses "focus"
onChange - only available for <input> & <select> (and a few others), triggered when changed
onDoubleClick - the element was double-clicked!
onPlay - a video starts playing
onSubmit - a form element is submitted
Notice that just like with addEventListener above, we pass the
function reference to onClick instead of calling the function.
If we call the function, it will run the function when we render,
not when the user clicks on the button.
(Remember that rendering is the term in React for inserting into the DOM).

NOTE
Think of it like this: we give the event handler to React, 
so that React can call our function when the element is clicked.

Passing Functions as Props
Sometimes we need to pass a function to another component as a prop, so that 
it can handle the event.

A common example for this is a Button component. This component adds some styling 
to a normal <button>, but still needs to be able to pass an event handler function 
to onClick. Let's look at an example

function ClickLoggerApp() {
  function logWhenClicked() {
    console.log("Button was clicked");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <FancyButton handleClick={logWhenClicked} />
      <p>Then look in the console.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function FancyButton(props) {
  return (
    <button className="my-fancy-classname" onClick={props.handleClick}>
      Click Me!
    </button>
  );
}

Notice how this is very similar to the example above where 
we created the handler and used it in the same component?
The only difference here is that we are passing the function
reference through a prop. We could even pass it through multiple
components as props.

Re-rendering components
So far we've seen that when the page loads, React calls our function
components. The JSX elements that are returned from the component 
functions are turned into the DOM for you by React.
To be able to react to changes, we need to re-render
our function components to get different JSX elements.
React can then update the DOM based on the new JSX elements.

Let's look at how a component is re-rendered

function Counter(props) {
  console.log(`Rendering. props.likeCount is ${props.likeCount}`);

  return <button id="like-button">Likes: {props.likeCount}</button>;
}

If you look in the console, you'll see that the component is rendered once 
when the page loads.
props.likeCount starts at 0, so React inserts "Count: 0" into the DOM.
We won't look at how this works at the moment, but behind the scenes 
there is some code that will listen for clicks on the button and
force React to update. That means when you click the button, 
the function component is called again (or re-rendered).
Now props.likeCount is 1. React now updates the DOM to make 
sure it shows the correct number. Every time we click the button,
the function component is called and React updates the DOM for us.
We don't need to worry about changing the DOM ourselves! 
This is what makes React so powerful. Even better, React will 
figure out exactly the right bits of the DOM that need to be changed,
a concept called the "virtual DOM". This makes it extremely efficient 
and fast.

State
State is a general concept in software engineering.
It is used when a part of your app needs to "remember" 
something that changes when people interact with it.

React Hooks
React has built-in functionality for initialising and updating 
state in our components. We will access state via a React Hook called useState.
Hooks are a new-ish feature in React. You may find older tutorials 
that don't use Hooks, but don't panic. The concepts we learn here are the same whether or not you use Hooks. 
We are looking at Hooks first because they are simpler to learn for beginners.

Importing useState
To be able to access the useState Hook, we first need to import it from the React package.
 Let's look at an example (interactive example):

 import React, { useState } from "react";
console.log(useState);

If we look at the console, useState is just a function. 
It lives inside the React code that you installed when you created the app.

To reference the useState function in our component, we need to import it from the React code. 
The curly braces around useState are a bit like writing:

import React from "react";
let useState = React.useState;

In fact we can just write React.useState in our component if we want! 
But to type a bit less code, we import it (using the curly braces)
once and then can just use useState.

Using useState
Now let's look at how we can use the useState Hook 

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <p>You clicked {count} times</p>;
}

Let's break this down into small pieces.
 First, let's look at calling the useState function:

 useState(0);

 This initialises the state variable to 0. 
 Any parameter passed to useState will be used as the initial value.

Next, let's look at how we render the state variable in our component:

return <p>You clicked {count} times</p>;

count is just a variable, so to insert it into our JSX 
we treat it like any other variable: we use curly braces.

Finally, let's look at how we get hold of the count variable:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

If you remember back to JS Core 3 Week 3, 
we covered destructuring. As a reminder, you can assign 
variables to parts of an array with destructuring:

let [firstWord, secondWord, thirdWord, fourthWord] = [
  "Hello",
  "Code",
  "Your",
  "Future",
];
console.log(firstWord); // Prints "Hello"
console.log(secondWord); // Prints "Code"
console.log(thirdWord); // Prints "Your"
console.log(fourthWord); // Prints "Future"

In React, useState will always return an array with two items. 
The first item in the array is the current value of the count state. 
In our example it will be 0 on the first render. 
The second item in the array is a function that we will use
to update our state.

NOTE
Follow the useState naming convention.

When we destructure an array, we can name the variables whatever 
we want, but there is a naming convention when destructuring the 
useState array. The first variable should be named whatever your 
state is called, and the second variable should be the same name 
but prefixed with set. 
Let's look at some examples:

const [userIsLoggedIn, setUserIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

const [username, setUsername] = useState("chris");

const [unreadMessages, setUnreadMessages] = useState(5);

Updating State
Our Counter isn't very useful right now! Let's make it more useful
by getting count to actually count up (interactive example):

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function incrementCount() {
    setCount(1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
    </div>
  );
}
Our component now has a <button>, which will call the 
incrementCount function when clicked:

<button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>

The incrementCount function calls setCount to set the new state to be 1:

function incrementCount() {
  setCount(1);
}

setCount does two things. First, it updates the state that our 
component is "remembering". Whatever you pass as the argument 
to setCount will be remembered as the new state.
It also tells React that the old state that is still shown in 
the DOM is outdated and so the DOM needs to change. 
Because of this, React will re-render all of our components to 
figure out what to change in the DOM.

When re-rendering, React will call our Counter component again,
but this time when we call useState it will give us the updated 
state of 1, instead of the initial state of 0:

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  ...
}
On the second render, count is now set to 1. If we wanted to set the 
state to a different value, then we pass a different value to setCount.

Setting state based on previous state
You might have noticed that our Counter app isn't very useful...
It can only count to 1!
You might think that we could do something like this

function incrementCount() {
  setCount(count + 1);
}
However, this code has a bug. Let's see what happens if we put 2
setCount calls within incrementCount

function incrementCount() {
  setCount(count + 1);
  setCount(count + 1);
}

If you click the button, then the counter will only count up to 1. 
This is because the count variable does not actually update until
the component re-renders and useState gives a new value of count.
We can see this if we put a console.log(count) in-between the setCount calls.
As you can see, count remains at 0, even after we try to update it to 1.
This means that in the second setCount call we are actually still trying
to update the state to 1!

To fix this problem, there is another way we can call setCount if
we always need to get the latest version of state when setting it

function incrementCount() {
  setCount((c1) => {
    return c1 + 1;
  });
  setCount((c2) => {
    return c2 + 1;
  });
}
When we pass a callback function to setCount, React will pass
us the latest version of the count state. In this example, the 
variables are named c1 and c2 to make it clear that they are 
different from the count variable. Now if we add console.log(c1)
and console.log(c2) then we can see that they get the correct values.

Reminder: c1 and c2 are just arbitrary names we pick to be the name
of the parameter to the function we're passing - we could have called
them both c, and everything would still work - they're not related to
each other, as they are defined in different scopes.

TIP
If you need to calculate the new state based on the old state, then use 
the callback function to make sure the variable is up-to-date.

Don't mutate State
As we just learned, setCount updates the state for us,but it also notifies
React of changes. If you try to just change the count variable without using
setState, nothing will happen, because React wouldn't be notified of the change. 
You can only modify (or mutate) state using the setter function 
Fix the above code 

function Counter() {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    count = count + 1;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Where does State live?
We have talked about how a component "remembers" state. 
In fact, each component instance remembers separate state 
from other components. This means we can have multiple 
different Counters, each with a different state

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

More complex states
The examples we've looked at so far have used numbers,
strings and booleans. You can also use arrays and objects
in state too. Let's take a look at an example 

function ShoppingList() {
  const [list, setList] = useState([]);

  function addToList() {
    setList(list.concat("Bread"));
  }

  return (
    <p>
      <button onClick={addToList}>Add item to list</button>
      {list.map((item, index) => {
        return <li key={index}>{item}</li>;
      })}
    </p>
  );
}

In this shopping list example, we're initialising the list 
state to be an empty array. To display our list we loop 
through the array and render an <li> for each item in the list.

When we want to add something to the list, we can use the 
list.concat method to make a new array with the new item. 
This new array is then set as the new state. Right now,
our example is not very useful as it can only add Bread 
to the list! we'll look at how we can allow users to
write their own items to the list.

Don't use the array push method with state. Instead use 
the array concat method.

The list.push method won't work here, as this method mutates
the existing array. React requires a completely new array to
be set as the new state, otherwise it doesn't realise that the
value has changed. The concat method works because it copies 
the whole existing array to a brand new array before it adds 
the new item.

Setting multiple States
So far we've only seen an example with one state variable.
But you can create multiple state variables if you want! 
Let's see an example

function Weather() {
  const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState(15);
  const [conditions, setConditions] = useState("sunny");

  function makeItHotter() {
    setTemperature(temperature + 1);
  }
  function makeItColder() {
    setTemperature(temperature - 1);
  }

  function makeItSunny() {
    setConditions("sunny");
  }
  function makeItRainy() {
    setConditions("rainy");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature will be {temperature}°C</li>
        <li>The conditions will be {conditions}</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />
      <button onClick={makeItHotter}>+</button>
      <button onClick={makeItColder}>-</button>
      <button onClick={makeItSunny}>Make it sunny</button>
      <button onClick={makeItRainy}>Make it rainy</button>
    </div>
  );
}

When do you use Props or State?
We've looked at the 2 main ways of managing data in our React
components. But when should we use props and when should we use state?

Remember that props are like "arguments" to a component. 
It's good practice to make sure that you don't modify arguments 
after you receive them. Just like state, React prevents you from 
mutating them. Let's have a look at an example

function Greeting(props) {
  function handleThing() {
    props.name = "Mozart";
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello {props.name}</p>
      <button onClick={handleThing}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

When you click the button, you might expect the name prop 
to change to "Mozart".
But it doesn't! React has made props read-only, which is a
reminder that we shouldn't change props.

If we were allowed to change props, React doesn't have a way of
telling that we've changed the data. Our UI is now stale - not up-to-date
with the latest data - and has no way of knowing that it has to re-render.

From this we can get a clue about when to use state. If data changes over
time, then we need to use state. My rule of thumb is that I always use props
until I know that it needs to change over time, then I convert it to state.

Further Reading
What happens if you forget to pass a prop to a component?
Or if you pass the wrong type of data to a component? Sometimes
React will just render an empty element but sometimes it could 
throw an error! This is why propTypes are useful. This page on 
the React documentation describes how to use propTypes in more detail.
