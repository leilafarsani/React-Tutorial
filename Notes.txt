Babel is a compiler for JS
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into
a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
-Transform syntax
-Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment 
(through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
-Source code transformations (codemods)
-And more! 

Component is like a function in JS that we use functionalities and templates.
Functionalities could be any codes in JS
Templates are HTML tags that we use to make any frame, or fronts or etc. 
However, these templates are used in the form of JSX

What is vanilla JS used for?
"VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional 
libraries like jQuery back in the days. People use it as a joke to remind other 
developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional 
JavaScript libraries."
